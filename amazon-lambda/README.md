# Quarkus on Amazon Lambda

This is a simple demo application showing Quarkus usage with Amazon Lambda.  The included deploy script is what I use to build and bundle
 the application and deploy it to Amazon.  There are a few rough edges (application bundling) that we'll hopefully smooth over in time 
 but this should get you started.
 
## Build requirements
This currently requires that you check out this [pull request](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/3180) and run
a local install.
