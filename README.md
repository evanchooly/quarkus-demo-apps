# quarkus-demo-apps
demos and POCs of quarkus integrations/extensions

This repository serves two main purposes:

1. A place to build apps to test integrations as I work on them.
2. A repository to showcase (simple) examples of how these extensions work (at least at the time of writing)

These aren't necessarily intended to be authoritative or forever but at least allow me a chance to share with others works in progress as these extensions are developed and any wrinkles ironed out.  Ultimately, the quarkus project itself should be the ultimate reference but hopefully this will be helpful to others along the way.

# tl;dr

These apps work as of time of development.  No guarantees are made that these are maintained over time.
